## 💡 Project Overview

This project is an interactive web-based infographic that explores the dual nature of social comparison, which we've termed **"The Comparison Virus."**

It investigates how the pervasive, modern urge to compare ourselves to peers—in academics, careers, and social life—can be both a powerful motivator for self-improvement and a significant source of psychological distress.

## 🎯 Core Concepts

The "Comparison Virus" is a modern label for a timeless human tendency. This project examines this phenomenon, touching on key psychological concepts:

* **Duality of Comparison:** We explore both upward comparison (which can lead to motivation *or* misery) and its impact on well-being.
* **Cognitive Dissonance:** This ties into our group name, "Cognitive Resonance." We explore the mental discomfort (dissonance) that arises from holding conflicting views, such as, "I am a capable person," versus, "I am failing compared to my peers."
* **Psychological Well-being:** The project directly analyzes the link between comparison habits and outcomes like anxiety, self-esteem, envy (a key concept in traditional psychological thought), and burnout.
* **Contextual Amplifiers:** We look at how modern tools like **social media** and high-pressure environments like a **competitive campus culture** act as "amplifiers" for this virus, intensifying its effects.
