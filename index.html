            <h1>The "Comparison Virus": Between Motivation and Misery</h1>
            <p class="intro-hook">Since time immemorial, humans have looked to others to gauge their standing. In today's interconnected world, this deep tendency, felt acutely on campus, takes on new significance.</p>
            <p class="intro-define">This 'Comparison Virus' is the pervasive urge to evaluate ourselves against peers in grades, achievements, internships, and social recognition.</p>
            <p class="intro-question"><strong>Is this constant assessment a silent motivator, or a source of profound misery?</strong> Our study investigates this dual nature, understanding how comparisons shape mental well-being on campus, amplified by social media.</p>
